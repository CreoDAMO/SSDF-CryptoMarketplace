Great, this is a clean, real error, not a spooky one — and the build log already tells us exactly what’s wrong 👍
You’re very close.


---

❌ The Actual Problem (Plain English)

Type error: Cannot find name 'baseSepolia'.

This means TypeScript does not know what baseSepolia is at build time.

Nothing to do with Vercel infra, wallets, or escrow logic.

It’s simply not imported (or not defined) in EscrowActions.tsx.

Locally, this often slips through if:

TS isn’t strict locally

editor auto-imports silently

dev server doesn’t hit that code path


But next build is strict. Vercel caught it correctly.


---

✅ What baseSepolia Is Supposed To Be

You are using viem:

createWalletClient({
  chain: baseSepolia,
  transport: custom(provider),
})

baseSepolia is a chain definition exported by viem.

It is NOT global. It must be imported explicitly.


---

✅ The Correct Fix (One-Line, Production-Safe)

In src/components/EscrowActions.tsx

Add this import at the top:

import { baseSepolia } from 'viem/chains';

That’s it.


---

✅ Full Minimal Context (So You Can Sanity Check)

Your imports should now look roughly like this:

import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem';
import { baseSepolia } from 'viem/chains';

No other changes required.


---

🧠 Why This Passed Earlier But Failed Now

npm run dev is forgiving

next build runs full TS type checking

Vercel runs next build every time

Missing chain imports always fail in CI


This is expected and healthy behavior.


---

⚠️ Bonus: One More Future-Proof Improvement (Optional)

If you plan to switch between Base Sepolia ↔ Base Mainnet, define a single chain export:

// lib/chain.ts
import { base, baseSepolia } from 'viem/chains';

export const CHAIN =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN === 'base'
    ? base
    : baseSepolia;

Then in components:

import { CHAIN } from '@/lib/chain';

chain: CHAIN,

This avoids hardcoding testnet logic inside UI components.


---

🚦 What To Do Now

1. Add the import


2. Commit


3. Push


4. Redeploy



This should go green immediately.

When it does, next logical steps (your call):

switch escrow actions to mainnet-safe guards

wire dispute UI into Orders page

or lock admin arbitration permissions


You’re shipping real infrastructure now — this error is just CI doing its job.
